I'm creating a web app for tracking shared expenses and calculating how much each person owes and to whom. 
It is called paybaq. I'm using go and datastar and implementing a cqrs model using sqlite and event sourcing. 
I'm using the chi router and the templ package for templating. 
I'm using sqlite for the database. 

Here is the database schema for the events:
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS events (
  id				INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  entity_type		TEXT NOT NULL, -- Type of the entity which the event is related to
  entity_id    		TEXT NOT NULL, -- Id of the entity which the event is related to
  entity_version	INTEGER NOT NULL, -- Version of the entity, incremented on each event
  event_type      	TEXT NOT NULL, -- Type of the event
  event_payload   	JSON NOT NULL CHECK (json_valid(event_payload)), -- Data that defines the event
  metadata        	JSON NOT NULL CHECK (json_valid(metadata)), -- Metadata about the event
  created_at		TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP -- When the event was created
);

CREATE UNIQUE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_events_stream_version
  ON events (entity_type, entity_id, entity_version);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_events_type_id
  ON events (entity_type, id);

And the schema for ledgers which are is the primary view:
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ledgers (
  ledger_id     TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  ledger_data   JSON NOT NULL CHECK (json_valid(ledger_data)),
  updated_at    TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
